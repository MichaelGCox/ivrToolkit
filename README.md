ivrToolkit
==========

Please note that the intent is to change this license from the GPL to either the MIT license or the LGPL. This should
happen roughly in a month from now. 

An IVR toolkit written in c# for use with dialogic cards and others that are written with a plugin interface. Eventually this toolkit will support VoiceXML, CCXML and other telephony standards.
